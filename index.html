<p>
Welcome to Country Lane Kennel, where we let the country bring out the best in your pet!
</p>
<p>
We are located in Forestville, Ontario. (between Turkey Point and St. Williams) On a secluded 50 acres,
at the end of a dead-end road.
</p>
<p>
My family and I live on the premises, so we are always close by to answer to your pet&#39s needs.
</p>
<p>
I have always had a passion for animals, since I was a little girl. It all started on my family farm, bringing
home baby bunnies, snakes, owls, and even black birds that I had found on my daily adventures with
my German Shepard, named Tiger. Taking care of them or nursing them back to health became a
high priority, with the help of my mom and dad. My mom, on a 4 hour bottle feeding schedule for the
bunny, and my dad digging up the WHOLE yard for dew worms to feed the black bird. I am sure that
is where my love for animals came from! Their dedication and devotion to animals, has made an ever
lasting impression on me!
</p>
<p>
Now I have a farm of my own, with a loving environment for my chickens, horses, dogs, and cats.
</p>
<p>
Formerly I was a PSW for 24 years  taking care of the elderly and the sick. I have learned even more about
compassion, dedication, patience, and love than I thought was possible. I am now carrying on those
life lessons full-time in the animal world.
</p>
<p>
I will devote myself to the care and needs of each and every pet that comes through my doors at
Country Lane Kennel.
</p>
<p>
Thanks, Julie Ferris

omestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.

<div class="three-column">
Although experts largely disagree over the details of dog domestication, it is agreed that human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies.[29] Domestication may have occurred initially in separate areas, particularly Siberia and Europe. Currently it is thought domestication of our current lineage of dog occurred sometime as early as 15,000 years ago and arguably as late as 8500 years ago. Shortly after the latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human populations, and spread throughout the world.

Emigrants from Siberia likely crossed the Bering Strait with dogs in their company, and some experts[who?] suggest the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago
